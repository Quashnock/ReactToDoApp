# ReactToDoApp

For this project I wanted to experiment with using basic React to make my apps
more functional and tailwind to make css styling easier. This project uses 
state hooks to keep track of the list of todos when they are added and 
removed as well as keeping track of user input. The project was created 
using vite.
